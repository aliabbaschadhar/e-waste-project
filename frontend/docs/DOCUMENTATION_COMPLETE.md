## 🔑 Key Insights Documented

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All auth state lives in `App.tsx`
2. **Props Flow Down**: State passed to children via props
3. **Callbacks Flow Up**: Children call parent functions to change state
4. **No Backend Yet**: Everything is client-side, in-memory
5. **Protected Routes**: Dashboard checks authentication
6. **Role-Based UI**: Different dashboards for different roles
7. **Form State**: Local to component, becomes global on submit
8. **No Persistence**: Refresh page loses auth state
9. **3 User Roles**: USER, RESTAURANT, ADMIN
10. **Prop Drilling**: Passes props through multiple levels

## 🚀 Next Steps After Reading

1. **Understand the flow** (done with these docs!)
2. **Read the actual code**:
   - Open `/src/App.tsx`

   - Change button text
   - Add a new field to form
   - Modify a navigation function
4. **Plan improvements**:
   - Add localStorage for persistence
   - Add real backend API calls
   - Implement error handling
   - Add form validation
